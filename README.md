# Volatility Forecasting + A–S Market Making (Individual Contribution Part)

This repository includes the modules I independently implemented for a group project on volatility forecasting and Avellaneda–Stoikov market making. 

The full project remains private due to academic policy; therefore, this subset is **not intended to run standalone**, but it showcases my contributions to:

- High-frequency data merging & cleaning  
- Volatility forecasting modules (EWMA, Realized Vol)  
- A–S market-making simulation engine  
- Performance metrics & reporting utilities  

Files included (my work only):  
- `0.data_combine.py` – multi-day OKX orderbook merger  
- `benchmark_structure.py` – A–S simulator, risk logic, analytics  
- `1.benchmark_strategy_performance.py` – multi-model backtest runner
