# QF603-Market-Making-Strategy (Individual Contribution)

This repository contains only the modules I independently implemented as part of a larger group project.  
The full project is not public due to academic policy.  
Therefore, this subset is not intended to run standalone.

Contents:
- pca_factor.py – PCA factor construction
- portfolio_opt.py – eigen-portfolio optimization
- backtest_demo.ipynb – demonstration of usage
